# WriteCodeEveryDay

## Motivation

- To write code as habit.
- To get knowledge of engineering.
- to improve coding skills.


## Rule

1. I must write code every day.
2. It must be useful output.
	- No formatting source code likes tweaking indentation.
	- Including technical refactoring and writing blog. 
3. All code must be written before midnight.
4. The code must be Open Source and up on Github.
